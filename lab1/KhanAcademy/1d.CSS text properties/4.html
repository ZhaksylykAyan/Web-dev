<p id="routine">My day starts with waking up at 7 am. First of all, I go to wash my face, then have breakfast. After breakfast, I start preparing for the university. I pack my things, get dressed and go to the university. I had a lecture at 9 am on the Kazakh language. Then I had an hour break and after the break I had a lecture on ICT. After studying, I returned home and started doing homework in other subjects.</p>
