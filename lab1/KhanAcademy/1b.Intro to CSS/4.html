<h1>Travel to Kazakhstan</h1>
<p><strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, officially the <strong>Republic of Kazakhstan</strong>, is a <em>transcontinental country</em> located mainly in <em>Central Asia</em> and partly in <em>Eastern Europe</em>. It borders <em>Russia</em> to the north and west, <em>China</em> to the east, <em>Kyrgyzstan</em> to the southeast, <em>Uzbekistan</em> to the south, and <em>Turkmenistan</em> to the southwest, with a coastline along the <em>Caspian Sea</em>. Its capital is <strong>Astana</strong>, known as Nur-Sultan from 2019 to 2022. Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, was the country's capital until 1997. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, the largest and northernmost Muslim-majority country by land area, and the ninth-largest country in the world. It has a population of 19 million people, and one of the lowest population densities in the world, at fewer than 6 people per square kilometre (15 people per square mile).</p>

<h3>Kazakh Khanate</h3>
<p><em id="art">Main article:</em> <em>Kazakh khanate</em></p>
<p id="History">
    In 1465, the <em><strong>Kazakh Khanate</strong></em> emerged as a result of the dissolution of the Golden Horde. Established by Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan, it continued to be ruled by the Turco-Mongol clan of Tore (Jochid dynasty).
    Throughout this period, traditional nomadic life and a livestock-based economy continued to dominate the steppe. In the 15th century, a distinct Kazakh identity began to emerge among the Turkic tribes. This was followed by the Kazakh War of Independence, where the Khanate gained its sovereignty from the Shaybanids. The process was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the Kazakh language, culture, and economy.
